## First Blog Post

As the first blog post, I aim to address 3 main questions about general/philosophical topics in Data Science and another question trying to fit myself in as a Data Scientist vs Statistician. The questions are below:

1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

So, let's get started from the beginning and try to answer the first question.


### 1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

In my opinion, being a data scientist is about working with data gathered from several sources under the objective of extracting and understanding fundamental information and, after some modeling, answering game changing questions for the business strategy. In other words, a data scientist uses programming languages, like SQL, R, or/and Python, to mine tons of information, also known as Big Data, and recognise patterns that can be used for forecasting and extracting insights for a particular purpose. It is interesting to notice that data analysis might be seen as a fraction of data science due to the tasks normally executed by a data analyst, which may be doing some statistics, knowing how to work with databases, and applying nice visualization techniques to the dataset so it is easier to figure out the patterns. It is a fundamental part of data science without question. In addition, working with machine learning is a **must** for a data scientist, since the amount of data with which a data scientist has to deal on a daily basis requires advanced learning algorithms to efficiently return meaningful insights.


### 2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

The major duties of a data scientist are related to knowing what is called a "scientific" programming language, which can be R, Python, and/or SAS. By the way, there are many more programming languages that can be used for data science, these three are just the most common. It is fundamental to know at least two of them because there is a 100% chance that these languages will merge into an API (Application Programming Interface) at some point of your analysis. For example, R has several packages that can be loaded in its environment and many of them convert a Python library composed of advanced and flexible modeling functions to run within R. Python (and R) has SQL functions that can be loaded within its environment by an API, and so on. By the way, knowing SQL is also a major duty of a data scientist because SQL structures, queries, and updates large databases faster than any of the previous programming languages do in their natural environment.

A data scientist is supposed to know how to obtain data, from web scraping for instance, clean this data, through exploratory data analysis, and model the data obtained, several times using machine learning and/or statistical models.

However, in my opinion, the main duty of a data scientist should be to, first of all, understand the problem and its importance for a particular business and, then, use all the above described knowledge to extract meaningful information and address the research questions efficiently.


### 3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

From my perspective, statisticians are more interested in understanding and creating theories that help improve the existing methods or even create new methods for a particular purpose in a particular field. Terms like p-values, point estimate, and margin of error are very common in any statistical analysis. Actually, they are very common in data science as well since a data scientist uses the methods and concepts of statistics and probability theory applied to a particular purpose. However, data science also has as tools some techniques that statisticians tend to avoid, such as machine learning algorithms. In some sense, the statisticians have a good point because the theory of linear models is really complete in terms of control of what you can do and how to evaluate a model associating a probability distribution. This is a good point, but when the behavior of a particular variable is not entirely known, e.i. which variables drive the explanation of the variance of the response, then a machine learning algorithm may come to save the day. For instance, the big data producers nowadays need to process billions and billions of information at every moment and if they had to evaluate the model assumptions or accuracy everytime new data comes in, this becomes a nearly impossible task. Machine learning comes with the objective of providing ways of adapting and learning with and from the data in real time, usually called online modeling. Obviously these machine learning algorithms also need to be checked for accuracy from time to time, but they are constantly improved and adapted for a new unseen situation. Very often based on association of statistical learning methods. These features make statistics part of data science, although not all statisticians are data scientists, but data scientists must know statistics very well.


And finally, 

### 4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I will try to answer this question by reporting what is the first thing that comes to my mind when I start a project. My first question is *why is this project necessary?* followed by *who is the most interested in the results of this project?*. These questions are perhaps the most important questions of any project, because I should be able to understand the objective of the project in order to apply the correct amount of effort on it. Also, knowing the person who will have this information helps me to understand how I should present the  final report, which can be an article written for a scientific journal, a symposium, a supervisor, etc. Thus, knowing these two points always help me draw a workflow of tasks I should perform. After understanding and answering these questions, I think about how to address the main problem of this project. In other words, *what is the main problem I have to solve for this project?*. Now I can answer our main question of **How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?** by saying that I may classify myself as more of a data scientist than a statistician at this point, because I tend to give a more practical approach that can be understood as a "data science process" with some predefined steps, which I follow to help me get started. For instance, i) data wrangling and transformation, ii) exploratory data analysis, and iii) model selection and evaluation. Although, at the same time, I tend to use the statistical concepts which narrow the probability theory behind the data modeling, including the machine learning techniques. Let's use some proportions to classify myself into these two fields, just because it is fanier this way. I could say I am 0.65789 a data scientist and 1 - 0.65789 a statistician.

Thank you for reaching this far. See you next time!
