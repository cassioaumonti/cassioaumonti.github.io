## First Blog Post

As the first blog post, I aim to address 3 main questions about general/philosophical topics in Data Science and another question trying to fit myself in as a Data Scientist vs Statistician. The questions are below:

1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

So, let's get started from the beginning and try to answer the first question.


### 1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

In my opinion, being a data scientist is about working with data gathered from several sources under the objective of extracting and understanding fundamental information and, after some modeling, answering game changing questions for the business strategy. In other words, a data scientist uses programming languages, like SQL, R, or/and Python, to mine tons of information, also known as Big Data, and recognise patterns that can be used for forecasting and extracting insights for a particular purpose. It is interesting to notice that data analysis might be seen as a fraction of data science due to the tasks normally executed by a data analyst, which may be doing some statistics, know the how to work with databases, and apply nice visualization techniques to the dataset so it is easier to figure out the patterns. It is a fundamental part of data science without question. In addition, working with machine learning is a **must** for data science, since the amount of data with which a data scientist has to deal requires advanced learning algorithms to efficiently return meaningful insights.


And finally, 

### 4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I will try to answer this question by reporting what is the first thing that comes to my mind when I start a project. My first question is *why is this project necessary?* followed by *who is the most interested in the results of this project?*. These questions are perhaps the most important questions of any project, because I should be able to understand the objective of the project in order to apply the right amount of effort on it. Also, knowing the person who will have this information helps me to understand how I should present the  final report, which can be an article written for a scientific journal, a symposium, a supervisor, etc. Thus, knowing these two points always help me draw a workflow of tasks I should perform. After understanding and answering these questions, I think about how to address the main problem of this project. In other words, *what is the main problem I have to solve for this project?*. Now I can answer our main question of **How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?** by saying that I may classify myself as more of a data scientist than a statistician at this point, because I tend to give a more practical approach that can be understood as a "data science process" with some predefined steps, which I follow to help me get started. For instance, i) data wrangling and transformation, ii) exploratory data analysis, and iii) model selection and evaluation. Although, at the same time, I tend to use the statistical concepts which narrow the probability theory behind the data modeling, including the machine learning techniques.
