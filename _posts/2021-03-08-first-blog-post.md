## First Blog Post

As the first blog post, I aim to address 3 main questions about general/philosophical topics in Data Science and one fitting myself in as a Data Scientist. The questions are as follows:

1 What do you think being a data scientist is about?
2 What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
3 What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?
4 How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.
