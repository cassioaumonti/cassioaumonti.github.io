## First Blog Post

As the first blog post, I aim to address 3 main questions about general/philosophical topics in Data Science and another question trying to fit myself in as a Data Scientist vs Statistician. The questions are below:

1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

So, let's get started from the begining and try to answer the first question.


### 1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

In my opinion, being a data scientist is about working with data guathered from several sources under the objective of extracting and understanding fundamental information and, after some modeling, answering game changing questions for the business strategy. In other words, a data scientist uses programming languages, like SQL, R, or/and Python, to mining tons of information, also known as Big Data, and recognise patterns that can be used for forecasting and extrating insights for a particular purpose. It is interesting to notice that data analysis might be seen as a fraction of data science due to the tasks normally executed by a data analyst, which may be do some statistics, know the how to work with database, apply nice visualization techniques to the dataset so it is easier to figure out the patterns. It is a fundamental part of data science without question. In addition, working with machine learning is a `must` for data science, since with the amount of data with which a data scientist has to deal requires advanced learning algorithms to efficiently return meaninful insights.
