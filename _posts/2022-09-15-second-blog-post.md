Hello again,

Project 1 is done (link below) and it was great learning!!

In Project 1, the goal was to work with functions in R and work out the code organization and readability. In summary, there were several tasks that should be done using functions from packages, mainly from *tydiverse* package, and built-in functions present in the base R. These tasks encompassed reading in a .csv file, rename and select some variables, transform the file format from wide to long, work with strings and extract information from them, and encapsulate all these steps into functions.

The main reason one may have to build a function is repetition, in other words, if you have to perform a task multiple times, then build a function is a good idea. With a function one can make the code cleaner and interpretable as opose to have the same lines of code run copied several times across the script. Obviously nothing comes easily, to build a function the data scientist has to "think generally" and picture many situations that might come up when different situations arise. For example, when working with strings, it is important to keep in mind that the length of the string may change in large data sets (that was the case for project 1). When such issue comes in, then the concept of "think generally" is clear. Hence, the data scientis must create the function to adapt to that typo of changes (the expected ones). There is no way to be prepared to all possible changes that the data set can bring, so you can just throw an error message on screen and you are good to go. This way the user will know what is allowed to do with the function. This type of information is widely used in documentation of packages in R.
