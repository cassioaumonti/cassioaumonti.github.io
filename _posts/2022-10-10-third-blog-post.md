## Third Blog Post

This blog post regards the second project and the challenges in its production.

I can say it was an interesting experience working on this project, mainly because of API access. An API can be a powerful tool in accessing data and, in my case, I can say that accessing articles and scientific journals according to specific key words and end points may be really interesting. I had the oportunity to work a bit more with API in R environment and it was great.

I think the most interesting finding was related to the analysis of financial data regarding the ticker and market types. I can say that I have never worked with financial data before and this was a great introduction to categories we will find in the stock market and sometimes we can be lost with the variaty of information available. The most common market types and ticker types have provided a more refined view to which market and ticker type might be more related to my investment style. Also, some metrics as Moving Average Convergence/Divergence has shown to be important to indicate trends of growing/decresing prices, which was corroborated with the time series obtained using one of the end points. This time series data indicated a trend of increasing in the price for some companies even in times of deflation.

The most difficult part in the logic was to assemble the calls of the URL parts due to the wide variaty of options that each end points had available. I can say that this was the main difficulty in the programming part as well, because some of the parts connected and interacted with each other and it made more challenging the prodution of the URL call for the end points.However, I founf it fun this part because I went more in-depth to the financial API and all the options it provides.

The only issue we had in this project was related to the GitHub repository, which suddenly stopped publishing the .html file on the browser, which made us have to go towards another path in which we created another repository containing the published web page. I would do this part differently in future projects, if we had more time we could try to figure out what happened with the current repository and then solve the issue. Hence, I am providing two links: the first link below leads you to the web page with the published vignette; and the second link below leads you to the repository in which all the commits and work has been done and stored.

I hope you enjoy and that the vignette can be helpful for your analysis.

Thank you for reaching this far. See you next time!
