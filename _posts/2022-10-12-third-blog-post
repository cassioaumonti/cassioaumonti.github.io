## Blog Post about Project 2

Hello,

Project 2 is done now and it was amazing to work with API!!

In Project 1, the goal was to work with functions in R and work out the code organization and readability. In summary, there were several tasks that should be done using functions from packages, mainly from *tydiverse* package, and built-in functions present in the base R. These tasks encompassed reading in a .csv file, rename and select some variables, transform the file format from wide to long, work with strings and extract information from them, and encapsulate all these steps into functions.
