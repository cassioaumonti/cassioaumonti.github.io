# Project 3 - Blog Post

This blog post regards to the third project of ST558 course.

This project was exciting because we had the oportunity to work with report automation using Rmarkdown. This is a very useful tool if there are several reports of the same structure, but changing the data sets. Rmarkdown has a feature in the YALM header that is called `params` to which it is possible associate a list of names corresponding to each data set for the analysis. Then, we just have to call the function `render()`, from rmardown package, with the argument params = list("var_name") and Rmarkdown does the automation. Okay, perhaps it is not that simple.
