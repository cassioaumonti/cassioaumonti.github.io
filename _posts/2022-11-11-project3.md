# Project 3 - Blog Post

This blog post regards to the third project of ST558 course.

I can say it was an interesting experience working on this project, mainly because of API access part. An API can be a powerful tool in obtaining data and, in my case, I can say that accessing articles and scientific journals according to specific key words and end points may be really interesting through API. Now I know how to perform this task using R. The students had the opportunity to work a bit more with API in R environment and it was great, in my opinion.
