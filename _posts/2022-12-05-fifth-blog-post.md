# Fifth Blog Post - What's next?

This blog post refers to my perspective about analyses that I will be doing in practice after having had ST 558 course.

I must say, with no fear of being exaggerate, that ST558 is one of the most exciting and useful courses I have had so far in my academic life. In terms of R programming, the course was fantastic by presenting tons of intrinsic concepts that R uses, such as **class** and generic functions. Those tools will be definitely present in my skill set for further projects and programs.

The use of Rmarkdown has changed considerably my mind about Latex and how this programming tool is useful for building reports even in an automatic way. I have used the report automation feature already in another context and it has saved significant amount of time just by automating some basic report parts. Although, I have plans to automate other parts of the report that may not be considered so straightforward, such as the description of the data and the discussion. In real job applications, this feature from rmarkdown is, with no question, a remarkable skill to master.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part of the course was fundamental for me to understand a concept with which I have had contact but have never payed too much attention, the empirical cumulative distribution (ECD). This tool can provide information similar to what histograms and boxplots return and even more than that, ECD returns more stable analysis than histograms, with no need to find the number of bins, for instance. The ECD also works as outliers detector, which makes them really handy in the EDA. I will definitely pay more attention on EDA and more specifically on ECD in my further analyses. 

The tree based methods are amazing and I have plans to keep working with them to learn more about the most advanced methods related to tree models. I have already had several courses which went through linear regression and specifically GLM, ST558 was one of them. This fact just reinforces the idea of the importance of linear regression for data scientists and, of course, for statisticians. Linear regression remains the most useful tool set that any data scientist and statistician can and should rely on, due to its vast miscellaneous of methods and techniques all linked to probability theory, which gives more robustness to the concepts. However, my contact with modeling in ST558 has wrapped my mind around the fact that knowing methods for modeling is really important and this has helped me to develop more curiosity to get to know new techniques. So I have decided to learn more about Deep Learning and start to apply it on my researches, which is kind of cool.

Last but not least, **shiny** is amazing! I will be producing a shiny app as final product of my research. My committee will be shocked with the coolest presentation they have ever seen, it has definitely changed the way I see data visualization and presentation. Simply outstanding.

It has been a fantastic and opening mind experience!

I think now there is nothing to say but THANK YOU!!
